    title: Add postinstall svelte-kit sync and lock file tracking
    description: |
      Configure a postinstall/prepare script that runs 'npx svelte-kit sync' after dependency installation to auto-generate .svelte-kit/tsconfig.json. Ensure deno.lock is committed for reproducible builds. Add 'deno task check' (svelte-check) to CI-ready scripts. Discovered during B-4: svelte-kit sync must be run via npx (not deno run -A npm:svelte-kit), and .svelte-kit/ is required for TypeScript path resolution.

    title: "Fix svelte-check by adding @types/node and excluding node_modules type errors"
    description: |
      Running 'deno task check' (svelte-check) reports 43 errors, all from node_modules (vite, @sveltejs/kit, svelte-toolbelt). These are caused by missing @types/node and missing csstype type definitions. Install @types/node as a devDependency and configure tsconfig.json to skip library checking (skipLibCheck) or exclude node_modules from svelte-check. This was discovered while implementing B-5 (shadcn-svelte setup). Related to B-11 which covers CI-readiness of svelte-check.

      The root page (src/routes/+page.svelte) is still a placeholder. It should load all boards and either redirect to the single board if there's only one, or show a board listing page. This page lives outside the (app) layout group since it doesn't need the sidebar. Implement the +page.server.ts load function and the board listing UI with links to each board and a 'Create Board' CTA.

    title: "Install missing shadcn-svelte UI components (dropdown-menu, select, textarea, popover, dialog)"
    description: |
      Several specs reference shadcn-svelte components that aren't installed yet. The ColumnHeader needs dropdown-menu for its action menu (rename, set WIP limit, delete). The DeleteColumnDialog needs select for move-cards-to picker. CardDetail needs textarea for description editing. Install these via the shadcn-svelte CLI: npx shadcn-svelte@next add dropdown-menu select textarea popover. This unblocks column action menus, card detail editing, and delete column dialog with card migration.

    title: Board page with columns and card list
    description: |
      Build the main board view at /boards/[boardId]. Server load function fetches board with columns and cards (ordered by position). Render columns in a horizontal scrollable layout. Each column shows its header (name, card count, WIP indicator), card list, and an Add Card footer. Include Add Column button at the end. This is the core kanban view.
